# PBI-1: Chrome Extension Foundation

## Overview
Set up the foundational structure for the Gemini Chrome Extension using Manifest V3, establishing a secure and compliant base for all future development.

## Problem Statement
We need a properly structured Chrome extension that complies with Manifest V3 requirements and provides the basic infrastructure for authentication, messaging, and UI components.

## User Stories
As a developer, I want to set up the Chrome extension foundation with proper Manifest V3 structure so that I can build upon a secure and compliant base.

## Technical Approach

### Key Components
1. Manifest V3 configuration with proper permissions
2. Service worker for background processing
3. Basic popup UI with React/TypeScript
4. Message passing infrastructure
5. OAuth2 configuration for Google authentication

### Architecture

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Dev as Developer
    participant Chrome as Chrome Browser
    participant Ext as Extension
    participant SW as Service Worker
    participant Popup as Popup UI
    
    Dev->>Chrome: Load unpacked extension
    Chrome->>Chrome: Validate manifest.json
    Chrome->>SW: Register service worker
    SW-->>Chrome: Worker registered
    Chrome->>Ext: Extension installed
    
    Dev->>Chrome: Click extension icon
    Chrome->>Popup: Open popup.html
    Popup->>SW: Initialize connection
    SW-->>Popup: Connection established
    Popup-->>Dev: UI ready
```

### Core Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Chrome as Chrome
    participant SW as Service Worker
    participant MB as Message Bus
    participant SM as State Manager
    
    Chrome->>SW: Install extension
    SW->>SW: self.addEventListener('install')
    SW->>MB: Initialize MessageBus
    SW->>SM: Initialize StateManager
    
    alt First install
        SM->>Chrome: chrome.storage.local.get()
        Chrome-->>SM: No existing state
        SM->>SM: Create default state
        SM->>Chrome: chrome.storage.local.set()
    else Update/Reload
        SM->>Chrome: chrome.storage.local.get()
        Chrome-->>SM: Return existing state
        SM->>SM: Merge with defaults
    end
    
    SW-->>Chrome: Ready
```

### Error Handling

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Chrome as Chrome
    participant SW as Service Worker
    participant EH as Error Handler
    
    Chrome->>SW: Load extension
    SW->>SW: Validate dependencies
    
    alt Missing permissions
        SW->>EH: Report permission error
        EH->>Chrome: chrome.notifications.create()
        Chrome-->>User: Show error notification
    else Invalid manifest
        Chrome--xSW: Reject installation
        Chrome-->>Dev: Show manifest errors
    else Success
        SW-->>Chrome: Extension ready
    end
```

## UX/UI Considerations
- Minimal popup UI for initial setup
- Clear visual feedback for extension state
- Error messages displayed prominently
- Loading states during initialization

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Manifest V3 compliant manifest.json with correct permissions
- [ ] Service worker architecture implemented and functioning
- [ ] Basic popup UI renders without errors
- [ ] Extension loads successfully in Chrome Developer mode
- [ ] OAuth2 configuration properly set up in manifest

## Dependencies
- Chrome browser version 88+ (Manifest V3 support)
- Node.js and npm for build tooling
- React and TypeScript for UI development

## Open Questions
- Which specific Chrome permissions will be needed initially?
- Should we request all permissions upfront or use optional permissions?
- What should be the minimum Chrome version requirement?

## Related Tasks
Tasks will be created once this PBI is approved and moved to "Agreed" status.
